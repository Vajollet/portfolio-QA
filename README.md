# QA Testing Portfolio

This repository contains my work related to software testing.

## About Me

I'm exploring the QA field with interest and commitment.  
This space gathers my learning progress and practical exercises.  
I hold the ISTQB® Certified Tester Foundation Level 4.0 certificate.  
I'm open to developing further skills, gaining new experience, and learning tools used in the QA industry.

## What’s Inside

- Manual testing documentation (test cases, checklists, bug reports)  
- API testing with Postman (OpenWeatherMap API tests)  
- Example validations like response code, city name, temperature range, etc.
